== Model overview

=== Design requirements

The development of MUDDI has been motivated by a number of specific design
requirements:

Functionality::
The model should specifically address three priority application use cases
(Excavation, Large-scale Construction Design, Disaster Planning)

Compatibility::
The model should derive from or map to/from existing candidate models such as
INSPIRE [IUN] (Infrastructure for Spatial Information in the European
Community), CityGML UN ADE [CUA] (Utility Networks Application Domain
Extension), GeoSciML [GSML], or IMKL [IMKL] (Informatie Model Kabels en
Leidingen).

Modularity::
The model should have a modular structure with a simple mandatory core and
additional elements in the form of optional extensions or interfaces, in order
to minimize the quantity and detail of data required for specific use cases.

Traceability::
The model should provide for UGII to be linked directly with the survey
measurements, sensor observations, and supporting evidence from which it was
derived and from which its quality can be determined.

Flexibility::
The model should support implementations that include the geometric and
topological representations needed for specific applications, such as 2D
geometries for excavation planning, 3D geometries for construction design, or
functional graph topologies for disaster vulnerability assessments.

=== Design patterns

There are a number of common model design patterns which might satisfy MUDDI
requirements, particularly modularity and flexibility:

Relational::
the pattern of fixed tables connected by foreign key relations. Clearly an
established implementation pattern, but tends to result in duplication of data
to support specialization and rather brittle relationships between model
elements.

Graph::
an extremely flexible pattern of data elements connected by diverse relation
predicates tends to represent knowledge webs and physical networks very well,
but is still hard to implement for spatial data.

Object::
inheritance patterns are particularly well suited to UML modeling, but
specialization hierarchies themselves can lack flexibility in terms of being
able to choose different configurations of specialized attributes for specific
applications.

Interface::
a variant of the object model in which specializations can also be supported by
the addition of interface elements (consisting of attributes and/or operations)
to primary objects. Interfaces can be mixed and matched as well as reused for
different primary objects, but the variety of ways in which they can be
implemented may present a risk of non-interoperability between implementations.
