MUDDI (Model for Underground Data Definition and Interchange) is a set of models
that serve as the basis of integration of datasets that utilize different
information models in the representation of underground objects.

The MUDDI models are intended to form the basis for conformant and
interchangeable logical and physical implementations, such as GML (Geographic
Markup Language) or SFS (Simple Features SQL).

This OGC standard provides the full set of MUDDI conceptual models and their
requirements.
