== Introduction

The MDS process described in <<OGC_21-035r1>> enables standardized documentation
of conceptual models in UML, which could be platform-independent models (PIMs)
or platform-specific models (PSMs).

In the past, UML modeling activity and the OGC authoring process used
disparate tools, causing OGC authors and editors much pain in the
synchronization of changes originating from either activity, as illustrated
in <<mn-flow-old>>.

[[mn-flow-old]]
.Manual process for iterating a model-driven standard
image::mn-flow-old.svg[]


As studied in OGC Testbed-17, <<OGC_21-035r1>> has investigated several options
in model-driven authoring, in which the OGC MUDDI SWG has decided to adopt
and sponsor development of a particular approach that utilizes the following
combination of tools:

* Enterprise Architect (from Sparx Systems) in the creation and maintenance of
UML models, and

* Metanorma (from Ribose) in the authoring of OGC deliverables.

This combination of tools can provide a streamlined development environment
for OGC working groups developing conceptual model standards:

* By maintaining standards content in the model, simplifying and decoupling
  the model maintenance process is possible.

* Storing annotations and guidance about the model together
  with the actual model enables a single source of truth that can streamline the
  standards authoring process.

This document is meant to describe best practices that enable achievement
of these benefits.

By utilizing described practices of this document, the streamlined automated
MDS process can be achieved as shown in <<mn-flow-new>>.

== Developing an MDS

=== General

The creation of an MDS must be planned. An MDS involves the synthesis of
multiple data sources into a single one, therefore the MDS creator must be aware
of the integration points and limitations of such synthesis process.

While the MDS process is meant to be a streamlined, automated process, it is
nonetheless dependent on the interaction of multiple state-of-the-art
technologies and **requires** the MDS creator to have a thorough understanding
of the MDS technologies and techniques involved.

The full process is shown in <<mn-mbs-arch>>.

[[mn-mbs-arch]]
.Model-driven standard detailed publication flow
image::mn-mbs-arch.svg[]


=== Data sources

Before embarking on an MBS, it is necessary for the MDS creator to know what
kind of components there are.

In OGC, a model-driven standard is typically created with the following
components:

* OGC document information in Metanorma AsciiDoc (scope, bibliography, etc.)

* UML model information in OMG XMI format (the EA UML models with annotations)

* OGC ModSpec information in Metanorma AsciiDoc format (requirements, conformance tests)

These components read into Metanorma using a defined processing configuration,
and are then combined in Metanorma to form the MDS.

The resulting MDS represented in the Metanorma format will be expressed in
the models provided in <<mn-models>>.

[[mn-models]]
.Model-driven standard information components
image::mn-models.svg[]


=== Principles

<<OGC_21-035r1>> describes generating an MDS involves the following steps:

* Export: Making the information model available for processing

* Authoring: Making the supplementary truth available for processing

* Data parsing: Parsing the truth of the model into derived truth in the document

* Integrating: Merging derived and supplementary truth into the target document

* Rendering: Generating human-consumable presentations of the target document

This document provides practices that allow the MDS author to plan out how
the MDS automation process looks like across all these stages.


=== Export

Making source data available for the MDS involves exporting the information
models in a standardized interoperable format from the model authoring tool.

For an OGC MDS document:

* the primary truth is typically a set of UML models. The initial step in
processing is to export these UML models into interoperable XMI files.

* the secondary set of source data are the UML diagrams accompanying the UML
models. They provide visual representations of UML classes described
in the XMI files.


=== Authoring

This information is written in Metanorma, using the OGC flavor of the Metanorma
AsciiDoc markup language.

Supplementary information in an MDS normally includes the following:

* Material such as bibliographies, terminological definitions, tutorial
guidance, annexes, and prefatory material, which form part of a document
presenting and explaining the model.

* Metadata about the document, such as keywords and identifiers.

* Requirements conforming to OGC ModSpec.

Where the supplementary information references specific model artifacts
(annotating them), cross-references from Metanorma to the model become
necessary; those cross-references are part of the integration of derived and
supplementary truth.


=== Data parsing

Processing the XMI file is done under the Metanorma approach to MDA by LutaML,
LutaML returns to Metanorma an array of objects, one for each of the objects in
the source file parsed by LutaML, with a plugin structure to deal with the range
of formats LutaML is called on to process (`lutaml-xmi`, in this instance).

Metanorma then uses Liquid directives to iterate through those objects, and
insert information from them into Metanorma AsciiDoc templates. These templates
are how information from the model is incorporated into the MDS as derived
truth.

By using LutaML commands inside Metanorma, such as the
`lutaml_uml_datamodel_description` command, UML class information is parsed from
a nominated XMI file and transformed into Metanorma AsciiDoc.

Configuration files were used to specify which packages to render for each
command call, in which sequence, and how to display them.

For complex documents such as CityGML 3.0 that require a non-default way of
rendering, additional configuration can be used to achieve such results.


=== Integrating

A wide range of information is integrated into the target document.

This information is typically organized into separate directories in the source
repository:

* The main Metanorma AsciiDoc document (`nn-mmm.adoc`), containing document
metadata and directives to include sections contained in the document.

* The Metanorma AsciiDoc documents for each section in the standard
(`sections/*.adoc`).

* Generic ModSpec requirements (not specific to the information models), each
expressed as a separate file of Metanorma AsciiDoc, are included into the
section documents at the appropriate point (`abstract_test`, `recommendations`,
`requirements`).

* Non-model-generated images (`images`) and figures (`figures`) are included in
the document as supplementary truths, as distinct from the UML diagrams exported
into `/xmi-full/Images` as derived truths.

Supplementary truth is incorporated into the target document through standard
AsciiDoc commands:

* `image::` for images and figures
* `include::` for content.


=== Rendering

Once the Metanorma AsciiDoc source is assembled out of its component truths, it
can then be rendered using Metanorma into a number of
https://www.metanorma.org/author/topics/building/output-formats/[output formats]:

* Metanorma Semantic XML, capturing the structure and meaning of the standards
document, and following the document model in <<ISO_36100>>.

* Metanorma Presentation XML, denormalizing the structure of the standards
document in preparation for rendering, including resolving cross-references and
generating auto-numbering.

* HTML

* PDF

* Microsoft Word



== Technology and tools

=== General

Best practices described in this document are meant for OGC working group
participants fluent in the development of:

* UML conceptual models
* OGC authoring practices

This document does not delve into details in those areas -- readers may wish to
attempt further introductory for the full understanding of the practices
described.

=== UML conceptual models

==== General

<<ISO-IEC_19501>> specifies the UML modelling language, a graphical language for
visualizing, specifying, constructing, and documenting the artifacts of a
software-intensive system.

UML specifies a set of methodologies for developing technical artifacts used in
the design of a software system, ranging from business processes and system
functions to programming language statements, database schemas, and reusable
software components.
UML is often used to develop domain-specific models (e.g., geospatial
information) used in system development.

The usage of UML in MDS lies with two aspects:

* For model definition, the definition of information models and their
  relationships, that contain human- and machine-readable components; and

* For class diagrams, the visual arrangement of UML class relationships intended
  for human consumption only.


==== Modeling elements

NOTE: A detailed description on UML modelling capabilities can be found
in <<OGC_21-035r1,clause=5.1>>.

UML provides 3 basic modeling elements:

Package:: A package is a defined collection of interrelated classes.
Class:: A class is an abstract representation of a real-world object, which
contains properties.
Property:: A property represents an aspect of a class.

UML allows additional modeling extensions in the following 3 ways:

Stereotype:: A defined set of properties that a Class can adopt as a whole,
commonly representing a platform-specific or domain-specific concern.
More than one stereotype can be adopted by a single Class.

Tagged Value:: A structured key-value pair defined for a UML element, allowing
the attachment of additional (custom) information to the UML element.

Constraint:: A string that limits possible value assignments to the property.

The UML "Profile" is another mechanism that allows for the easy application
of stereotypes.

Profile:: A profile contains multiple UML stereotypes that a UML model
can adopt.

=== UML profiles for geospatial models

==== General

A number of common UML profiles are used for geospatial UML modeling.


==== UML Standard Profile

The UML Standard Profile is provided by the UML standard (<<OMG_UML>>).

It provides the following stereotypes for Classes:

«Auxiliary»:: A class that supports another class.
«Focus»:: A class that specifies core logic or control with auxiliary classes that provide subordinate mechanisms.
«ImplementationClass»:: An implementation class of a class.
«Metaclass»:: A UML element that is meant to be extended.
«Realization»:: A realization of an abstract UML element.
«Specification»:: A specialization of a UML element.
«Type»:: A data type.
«Utility»:: A class that supports functionality of more than one class.


==== GML

In the geospatial domain, stereotypes from the GML profile (<<OGC_20-010>>) are
often applied to geospatial UML elements.

The GML profile provides the following Stereotypes that apply to Classes:

«CodeList»:: A list of enumerated codes. Practically an enumeration.
«DataType»:: A basic type of information.
«FeatureType»:: A type of feature.
«Type»:: A type of information.
«Union»:: A union of two classes.

The GML profile provides the following Stereotypes that apply to Properties:

«property»:: A basic property.


==== ISO 19100-series profile: Conceptual schema language (ISO 19103:2015)

<<ISO_19103>> provides rules and guidelines for the use of a conceptual schema
language to model geographic information, and specifies a profile of UML.

It includes 6 stereotypes:

«Interface»:: (formerly `«Type»`) is an abstract classifier with operations,
attributes and associations, which can only inherit from or be inherited by
other interfaces (or types).

«DataType»:: is a set of properties that lack identity (independent existence
and the possibility of side effects). A data type is a classifier with no
operations, whose primary purpose is to hold information.

«Union»:: is a type consisting of one and only one of several alternative
datatypes (listed as member attributes); this is similar to a discriminated
union in many programming languages.

«Enumeration»:: is a fixed list of valid identifiers of named literal values.
Attributes whose range type is an enumeration may only take values from the
fixed list.

«CodeList»:: is a flexible enumeration that uses string values for expressing
a list of potential values. The allowed values are often held and managed using
an online register.

«Leaf»:: is a package that contains only classes (packages are disallowed).

The <<ISO_19103>> profile of UML also includes one tagged value:

* `codeList`, applies to stereotype `«CodeList»`: Code lists managed by a single
external authority may carry a tagged value "`codeList`" whose value references
the actual external code list. If the tagged value is set, only values from the
referenced code list are valid.


The <<ISO_19103>> profile of UML is summarized in <<fig11>>.

[[fig11]]
.<<ISO_19103>> stereotypes and keywords
image::iso-19103-stereotypes.png[]


==== ISO 19100-series profile: Rules for application schema (ISO 19109:2015)

<<ISO_19109>> defines rules for creating and documenting application schemas
(conceptual schemas for data required by one or more applications), including
principles for the definition of features, a fundamental unit of geographic
information. As part of the general rules for application schemas it specifies
the "`General Feature Model`" (GFM), the meta-model for application schemas.

The <<ISO_19109>> profile of UML that is used as the conceptual schema language
for application schemas adds 2 stereotypes and 3 tagged values.

«ApplicationSchema»:: (package) stereotype
«FeatureType»:: (class) stereotype

The following 3 tagged values apply to both of these stereotypes:

designation::
Natural language designator for the element to complement the name. Optional,
with multiple designations allowed in order to support different languages.

definition::
Concise definition of the element. One definition is mandatory. Additional
definitions can be provided in multiple languages if required.

description::
Description of the element, including information beyond that required for
concise definition but which may assist in understanding its scope and
application. Optional, with multiple descriptions allowed in order to support
different languages.

The <<ISO_19109>> profile of UML is summarized in <<fig12>>:

[[fig12]]
.Summary of <<ISO_19109>> profile of UML
image::iso-19109-uml-profile.png[]


==== ISO 19118:2011 Geographic information -- Encoding

<<ISO_19118>> specifies the requirements for defining encoding rules for use for
the interchange of data that conform to the geographic information in the set of
International Standards known as the "ISO 19100 series". It specifies
requirements for creating encoding rules based on UML schemas, requirements for
creating encoding services, and requirements for XML-based encoding rules for
neutral interchange of data. It specifies a profile of UML that includes eight
stereotypes, two of which are not previously defined similarly by either
<<ISO_19103>> or <<ISO_19109>>.

The profile provides the following stereotypes for Classes:

«BasicType»:: "`Defines a basic data type that has defined a canonical encoding.`" (<<ISO_19118,clause="C.2.1.2">>)
+
--
Additionally stated is that:
"`This canonical encoding may define how to represent values of the type as bits
in a memory location or as characters in a textual encoding. Examples of simple
types are integer, float and string.`"

NOTE: For translation into XML, <<ISO_19118,clause="C.5.2.1.1">> states: "`A
class stereotyped `«BasicType»` shall be converted to a simpleType declaration
in XML Schema. Any of the data types defined in XML Schema can be used as
building blocks to define user-defined basic types. The encoding of the basic
types shall follow the canonical representation defined in XML Schema Part 2:
Datatypes (<<W3C_XML2>>).`"

NOTE: The different types are not clearly defined in <<ISO_19103_2005>> and neither is
the `«BasicType»` stereotype used. The following declarations, therefore, follow
a subset of the data type definitions in <<W3C_XML2>>. Declared
are the types: Number, Integer, Decimal, Real, Vector, Character,
CharacterString, Date, Time, DateTime, Boolean, Logical, Probability, Binary,
and UnlimitedInteger (where the symbol "`*`" is used to represent the infinite
value).
--

«Interface»:: "`Defines a service interface and shall not be encoded.`" (<<ISO_19118,clause="C.2.1.2">>)
+
--
This definition is inconsistent with that of the subsequently
published <<ISO_19103>>. While this inconsistency may be useful in contexts
where it is clear which definition applies, in general it is undesirable to
overload the meanings of stereotypes within the OGC community, and in particular
thereby coming into conflict with a stereotype specified in <<ISO_19103>>.

While the stereotype `«Interface»` as defined in <<ISO_19118>> can be (and is
here) subsequently ignored, the stereotype `«BasicType»` is used in the
CityGML 3.0 Conceptual Model where it results in difficulties given its tie to a
specific encoding technology -- XML Schema -- and thus lack of true platform
independence. The CityGML 3.0 Conceptual Model redefines the stereotype
`«BasicType»` to mean "`defines a basic data type`", which is both circular and
differs from that of <<ISO_19118>>.
--


=== Sparx Systems Enterprise Architect (EA)

<<SSEA>> is widely used in OGC and ISO/TC 211 for the authoring and management
of UML models.

EA Version 16 is a Windows application, it can be run in 32-bit or 64-bit mode
on Windows, and can be run on other platforms using CrossOver (which is based on
WINE technology) with 32-bit emulation.


=== Metanorma for OGC

<<MN>> is an open-source framework for creating and publishing standardization
artifacts with the focus on semantic authoring and flexible output support.

"`Metanorma for OGC`" is an OGC-specific implementation that has been
approved as an official way to publish new OGC Standard documents since
2021-09-17. Metanorma-based document templates have been approved by the OGC
Document SubCommittee on 2022-02-25.

Metanorma for OGC documents are created in the Metanorma AsciiDoc format.
Metanorma AsciiDoc is a textual syntax for preparing a <<ISO_36100>> compliant
document model tree which can be rendered in a variety of presentation formats.

At its core, Metanorma provides a model-based documentation system and
prioritizes automation, through the following features:

* a set of standard document metamodels (according to <<ISO_36100>>) that allows
  different standardization bodies to create their own standardized deliverable
  model, which in turn relies on the following standardized models:

** <<ISO_36200>> standards metadata specification metamodels;
** <<ISO_690>> bibliographic and citation item models;
** <<ISO_10241-1>> and <<ISO_704>> concept organization and terminology models;

* a standard XML serialization (<<ISO_36300>>) for machine-readable
  standardization documents; and

* an open-source publishing toolchain that enables editors of standard documents
  to handle their documents from authoring to publishing in an end-to-end,
  "`author-to-publish`" fashion.

For OGC usage, it provides the following additional features:

* Rendering outputs in PDF, HTML, Microsoft Word, and <<ISO_36100>> XML formats;

* Support for specification of OGC Standards metadata, including document types,
  stages, identifiers and authorship;

* Support for specification of OGC ModSpec (<<OGC_08-131>>) model instances
  through a specialized syntax.

* For OGC MDS usage, Metanorma supports navigation for information models in the
  OMG UML/XMI format (OMG UML within OMG XMI in XML format, <<OMG_UML>>,
  <<OMG_XMI>>) generated from Enterprise Architect, through the LutaML information
  model parser.

<<fig151>> shows the range of models used in Metanorma, including the OGC-specific
use of OGC ModSpec.

[[fig151]]
.Models used in Metanorma
image::mn-models.svg[]


=== LutaML information model interface

LutaML is an initiative grown out of Metanorma that allows parsing various
machine-interpretable information models. LutaML adopts an extensible
processing architecture to allow parsing different information model languages,
through LutaML extensions.

Supported LutaML extensions include:

* EXPRESS, as specified in <<ISO_10303-11>>, is used heavily in smart
manufacturing, Industry 4.0 use cases and in BIM, where EXPRESS itself served as
the foundation of the IFC classes. The LutaML EXPRESS extension is available at:
https://github.com/lutaml/lutaml-express.

* OMG UML in OMG XMI, which is the canonical format of representing UML models
within XMI, an XML language defined by OMG <<OMG_XMI>>. The LutaML XMI extension
is available at: https://github.com/lutaml/lutaml-xmi.

* <<SSEA>> XMI, the proprietary extension of <<SSEA>> for the representation of
UML. The LutaML Enterprise Architect-specific XMI extension is implemented
within the LutaML XMI extension.

* LutaML UML, which is an ASCII syntax used to author OMG UML-compliant
UML models with the possibility to be exported into OMG XMI format.
The LutaML UML extension is available at: https://github.com/lutaml/lutaml-uml.
+
NOTE: The LutaML UML language is documented at
https://github.com/lutaml/lutaml-uml/blob/master/LUTAML.adoc[]

LutaML supports the dynamic referencing of elements from within a UML model.
For example, individual UML classes, attributes, stereotypes, Enterprise
Architect diagrams, can all be referenced through the unified interface provided
by LutaML.

Collection filtering, such as to find UML classes that match certain UML
stereotype, is also supported.

LutaML-XMI is the LutaML extension that parses <<OMG_XMI>> into a LutaML-UML
model.

Of course, each format that it reads in requires a separate plug-in to be
written to process it, and the processing of different formats can be highly
specialized work. That makes it important for MDA to coalesce around standard
ways of expressing models as much as possible, to minimize the up-front effort
of developing a new plug-in to read a new model format.

The LutaML-XMI plug-in supports parsing the proprietary XMI files
generated by <<SSEA>>, incorporating details only available in the vendor
proprietary XML portion of the XMI file.

This plug-in has been successful in recognizing the classes it expresses, their
attributes, and the relations between classes, as documented in
<<OGC_21-035r1>>.


=== Metanorma LutaML plugin

Metanorma interfaces with information models through the Metanorma
LutaML plugin (https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-plugin-lutaml).
This plugin is used to render information models in human-readable formatting
for MDS.

It provides a set of commands to be used within a Metanorma authoring context
that invokes LutaML processing of a specified file, which generates a
representation of that data usable within Metanorma.

Model navigation, dynamic referencing and collection filtering capabilities to
UML models are accessible within a Metanorma document through the corresponding
LutaML commands.

By default, LutaML is invoked to parse an external information model through a
Metanorma AsciiDoc block command, which requires the input of the following
information:

* as an argument, name of the source information model file;

* as an argument, the named context, which is the object variable name into
which the data file contents are parsed, as object attributes, recursively;

* as the contents of the block, a template, in Metanorma AsciiDoc format with
the Liquid template language (https://shopify.github.io/liquid/).

In effect, this provides a "`meta-authoring`" environment from within Metanorma.
In particular, the template language allows the attributes parsed by LutaML to
be incorporated in the block under the command.


== Basics of Enterprise Architect

=== Launch screen

Once the EA application is launched with a model file, the screen is shown as in
<<fig-ea-launch>>.

[[fig-ea-launch]]
.Launch screen of Enterprise Architect
image::ea-intro-first-launch.png[]

There are 4 basic panes in this screen:

* Browser: where the UML packages, models and properties are shown and can
be navigated.

* Main pane: the area in the middle (labelled with the tab "Start Page").
It is typically used to show and work with diagrams.

* Properties: shows all properties and attributes of the selected UML element,
whether it is a figure, package, class or property.

* Notes: shows textual annotations made to the selected UML element.


Relevant best practices:

* In the Notes pane, enter plain text in the Metanorma AsciiDoc format.
While the pane supports rich-text entry, the text is encoded in HTML based on
the antiquated Microsoft RTF format, and makes it difficult to perform any
post processing upon extraction.


=== Using the Browser pane

The top-level package in the Enterprise Architect file can be expanded
and drilled-down into.

<<fig-first-file>> shows how the hierarchy looks like.

[[fig-first-file]]
.Example of expanding the UML model hierarchy (source: MUDDI)
image::ea-intro-first-file.png[]

[[fig-browser-item-types]]
.Browser item types
image::ea-browser-item-types.png[]


In the Browser, there are 4 (basic) types of elements seen in its hierarchy
(see <<fig-browser-item-types>>):

* Packages: UML packages.

** The top-level item shown in <<fig-first-file>> is a UML package called "Model".

** The second item is a UML package called "Conceptual Model".

* Diagrams: UML diagrams.

** The 3rd and 4th items named: "fig: MUDDI Conceptual Model" and "MUDDI Core Conceptual Model"
are figures.

* Classes: UML classes.

** The 5th to 8th items are all UML classes.

* Property: UML element property.

** The 9th to 10th items are UML properties that belong to the class "Annotation".


=== Diagrams

When opening a diagram from the Browser pane, a tab will be opened in the middle
pane showing the UML diagram (see <<fig-ea-figure-open>>).

[[fig-ea-figure-open]]
.UML diagram in EA
image::ea-figure-open.png[]

NOTE: The UML diagram can be zoomed in via the "View" action in the ribbon tab.

When a diagram is selected in the Browser, the Properties and Notes panes
will be changed to reflect information about the selected diagram.

The MDS process uses the following information from an EA UML Diagram:

* Graphics of the diagram: is exported in the vector format and included
in the OGC deliverable.

* Title of the diagram: as the caption of the Figure in the OGC deliverable.

* Notes of the diagram: contents of the Notes (seen in the Notes pane) is
used as a "NOTE to Figure" in the OGC deliverable.

The title of the diagram is edited within the Properties pane when
the diagram is selected. See <<fig-ea-figure-property>>.

Model authors commonly create multiple diagrams but only wish to selectively
include diagrams in the MDS process.

To indicate to the MDS process that a diagram is to be included, the title
must be prefixed with `fig: ` ("fig:" with a space).

Diagrams that are not prefixed with `fig: ` will not be included in the MDS
process.


[[fig-ea-figure-property]]
.EA Diagram Properties pane
image::ea-figure-property.png[]



=== Packages

On selection of a UML Package, the Properties and Notes panes will reflect the
selected item.

The MDS process incorporates information of the UML Package, including:

* Notes of the UML Package: as the definition (description) of the UML Package (as
in the Notes pane) (see <<fig-ea-package-note>>).

* Name of the UML Package: name of the UML Package is used as the clause heading
in the OGC deliverable (see <<fig-ea-package-properties>>).

* Package details:

** URI: Identifier in URI format.

** "Visibility": `Public`, `Private`, `Protected` or `Package` visibility.

On selection of a UML Class in the Browser pane, the Properties
and Notes panes will reflect the selected item.

The MDS process heavily incorporates information of the UML Class, including:

* Notes of the UML class: as the definition (description) of the UML Class (as
in the Notes pane) (see <<fig-ea-class-note>>).

* Name of the UML class: name of the UML class, used as a clause heading in the
OGC deliverable (see <<fig-ea-class-property>>).

* Stereotype of the UML class: stereotype of the UML class, wrapped with `«` and
`»` characters in the OGC deliverable.

* Class properties:

** "Abstract" status: whether it is an Abstract class

** "Visibility": `Public`, `Private`, `Protected` or `Package` visibility

== Basics of Metanorma

=== General

Metanorma uses a syntax called Metanorma AsciiDoc, which is based on the
AsciiDoc format with a number of extensions.

An OGC Metanorma document is composed of two parts:

* Metadata
* Content body

=== Encoding

==== Metadata

===== General

The metadata portion is composed of the document header and attributes.
An example of the metadata portion is shown below.

[example]

===== Metanorma instructions

The following lines specify that this document is an OGC document,
and it should render the various specified types of output, including
XML, HTML, PDF, Word and RXL. RXL refers to the Relaton XML format which is
used for encoding bibliographic information, and is required for the Metanorma
site generation functionality.

The `:imagesdir:` attribute indicates that all images are located under
that path, when using the `image::{path}[]` directive.

[source,adoc]
----
:mn-document-class: ogc
:mn-output-extensions: xml,html,pdf,doc,rxl
:imagesdir: images
----


===== Document type and sub-types

OGC has an extensive list of document types and some of them require
specification of sub-types.

Please refer to <<MN>> for a full list of these values. If there is no sub-type
for the document type, do not specify a sub-type.

[source,adoc]
----
:doctype: standard
:docsubtype: conceptual-model
----


===== Document status

OGC document types are processed through different approval procedures, and
this attribute encodes the status of a document.

Please refer to <<MN>> for the list of statuses available for the particular
document type. Invalid statuses will result in warnings during document
generation.

[source,adoc]
----
:status: draft
----

===== Document identification

OGC documents are uniquely identified via two aspects:

* OGC document number. This is a unique number is obtained from the OGC portal through
a reservation process, in a pattern of "nn-mmm".
+
NOTE: "nn" refers to the year when the document number is reserved, and "mmm" is
a sequential number reflecting the number of documents in that year prior to
reservation.

* OGC unique identifier. This identifier is called the `external-id` in
Metanorma. This identifier typically has the pattern like `xxx/yyy`, and is
required to be unique across OGC.

===== Document provenance

An OGC document is typically developed under the scope of the OGC Technical
Committee.

[source,adoc]

:committee: technical
----

===== Document dates

The OGC standards development process specifies several approval related
dates. These dates need to be encoded as they pass through those stages.

===== OGC keywords

OGC requires all documents to have keywords specified for the purpose of
enabling user discovery.

[source,adoc]
----

==== Body

===== General

An OGC document has certain fixed and mandatory sections.

For a conceptual model document, it includes:

* Preface sections
* Clause 1: Scope
* Clause 2: Conformance
* Clause 3: Normative references
* Clause 4: Terms and definitions
* Clause 5 onwards: content body
* Annexes (optional)
* Bibliography

===== Preface sections

The preface sections are encoded as follows.

===== Terms and definitions

The terms and definitions section defines the terms used in the document,
which could be defined by the document or imported from other resources.

The terms and definitions section can encode complex concepts and relations,
for detailed documentation please refer to the <<MN>> website.

<2> Term for concept
<3> Alternate term for concept
<4> Definition of concept
<5> Source of concept
<6> Concept mention of a defined term in the same document


===== Content body

The content body is used to describe the conceptual model and is composed of one
or more clauses.

In an OGC MDS document, it is necessary to utilize one or more section to describe
the information model. Typically, the Metanorma LutaML plugin is used to
render the conceptual model in XMI format. Information on how to use this
automated process is described in <<lutaml-basic>>.

.Content body in Metanorma AsciiDoc
[source,adoc]
----
== Model overview

=== Design requirements

The development of MUDDI has been motivated by a number of specific design
requirements...
----

=== Building the document

==== Single document

The command to build a document is: `metanorma {filename}`.

.Example of running the `metanorma compile` command
====
This command compiles the Metanorma AsciiDoc file `my-ogc-standard.adoc` into an
HTML document.

[source,sh]
----
$ metanorma my-ogc-standard.adoc
----
====

==== Site

Metanorma supports a site build feature that is useful when multiple outputs are
expected.

A site manifest needs to be created at `metanorma.yml`, where it internally
specifies the component documents of this site.
An example is shown in <<prototype-a2-site-manifest>>.

[[prototype-a2-site-manifest]]
.Example of generating both OGC and ISO flavors using a site manifest

  collection:
    organization: "OGC"
    name: "OGC TB 17 D144 DGGS XMI model-driven standard"
----

Assuming that the `metanorma.yml` file exists at the current path,
the command to generate a site is:

[source,sh]
----
$ metanorma site generate
----

The resulting site will be built at `_site` which contains
the entry point of `_site/index.html`.



== Specifying requirements

=== General

This clause describes best practices on how OGC requirements are encoded
adhering to the OGC Modular Specification (<<OGC_08-131>>), also called the
"ModSpec", in an OGC deliverable.

OGC ModSpec specifies a requirements model scheme where requirements are
expressed through a set of UML models, with description on how these models are
to be treated and presented in OGC standards.

According to the https://www.ogc.org/ogc/policies/directives[OGC Policy Directives],
OGC standards that contain requirements must have those requirements conform to
<<OGC_08-131>>.

As OGC utilizes the Metanorma toolchain for publishing its standards, it is
necessary for the OGC author to understand how ModSpec instances are encoded in
the Metanorma format.


=== Background

Metanorma provides a special syntax for the encoding and embedding of
requirements compliant to OGC ModSpec, for the exporting of machine-readable
requirements as well as ModSpec-compliant rendering.

Specifically, the following models in ModSpec are supported in Metanorma:

* Conformance class
* Conformance test
* Requirements class
* Normative statements
** Requirement
** Recommendation
** Permission (not specified in ModSpec but allowed in <<ISO_19105>>, see
<<OGC_08-131,clause="4.20">>)

NOTE: The "`Conformance suite`", "`Conformance module`", "`Requirements module`"
models are not yet supported in Metanorma. Please contact
https://www.ogc.org/projects/groups/docteam[OGC DocTeam] if support is required.

In this document, we refer to "`recommendations`", "`requirements`" and
"`permissions`" collectively using the generic term "`requirement`".

[NOTE]
--
In some instances, the naming of terms that Metanorma uses in general is
used in Metanorma markup instead of the nomenclature used in the ModSpec:

* Metanorma uses _target_ to refer to what the requirement is about, rather
than the more specific language of the ModSpec, to ensure that requirements are
represented consistently within Metanorma.

* The different types of requirement expressed by Metanorma for ModSpec are about
different things, and the more abstract types of requirement are about other
requirements.
--


=== ModSpec models

==== General

A basic understanding of ModSpec is crucial in order to understand how to encode
ModSpec-compliant models.

This clause describes ModSpec models in simplified terms (see
<<OGC_08-131,annex=C>>).

==== Requirements class

A "`Requirement class`" consists of multiple "`Requirements`".

All "`Requirements`" within a "`Requirement class`" are about the same
standardization target type.

==== Requirement

A "`Requirement`" is a condition to be satisfied by a single standardization
target type.

==== Conformance class

A "`Conformance class`" consists of multiple "`Conformance tests`".

A "`Conformance class`" is associated with a single corresponding
"`Requirements class`".

Each "`Conformance test`" within the "`Conformance class`"
corresponds to a set of "`Requirements`" within the corresponding
"`Requirements class`".

==== Conformance test

A "`Conformance test`" checks if a set of "`Requirements`" is met by a single
standardization target (an entity).

A "`Conformance test`" has a many-to-many relation with "`Requirements`".

A "`Conformance test`" is about a single standardization target.

A "`Conformance test`" can be "`concrete`" or "`abstract`" depending on the
type of conformance test suite (see <<OGC_08-131,clause=6.4>>). A concrete
conformance test is typically called as a "`conformance test`", while an
abstract conformance test is called an "`abstract test`".

==== Conformance test suite

A "`Test suite`" is "`a collection of identifiable conformance classes`"
(see <<OGC_08-131,clause=6.4>>)

A "`Conformance test suite`" contains only "`Conformance classes`" of the
"`concrete`" kind. Such conformance class can only contain "`concrete`"
conformance tests.

An "`Abstract test suite`" contains only "`Conformance classes`" of the
"`abstract`" kind. Such conformance class can only contain Abstract tests.


=== ModSpec instantiation

ModSpec models are defined as classes. In order to create ModSpec models inside
an OGC deliverable, it is necessary to "instantiate" them into ModSpec
instances.


[[instance-syntax]]
=== Encoding of ModSpec instances

==== General

A ModSpec instance is encoded in the Metanorma AsciiDoc markup language, via
tagged blocks with definition lists, containing other tagged example blocks and
open blocks.

NOTE: Metanorma also supports the OGC legacy "block attribute" syntax,
but it is not described in this document since it is no longer recommended
for the flexibility in the newer syntax.


This syntax requires specification of a `[%metadata]` definition list within a
ModSpec instance, which provides the necessary information for the specified
model. Values given in the definition list syntax can be fully-formatted
Metanorma AsciiDoc text.

A ModSpec model instance is encoded with one of these block types:

* `[requirement]` for Requirement
* `[recommendation]` for Recommendation
* `[permission]` for Permission
* `[requirements_class]` for Requirements class
* `[conformance_test]` for Conformance test
* `[conformance_class]` for Conformance class
* `[abstract_test]` for Abstract test

NOTE: These ModSpec types are available from [added in Metanorma OGC version v1.4.3]

In addition, if the Metanorma generic `[requirements]` block is used, these
values are to be used in the `type` attribute.

The following two encodings are equivalent:

[source,asciidoc]
----
[conformance_test]
----

[source,asciidoc]
----
[requirement,type=conformance_test]
----


Attributes that can take rich textual input (Metanorma AsciiDoc input), such as
`part`, `conditions`, and `guidance`, are components of requirements in
Metanorma.

These can be encoded within the definition list, or in the block attributes
syntax using the `[.component]` role within the ModSpec instance block, on open
blocks or example blocks.

[example]
.Example of encoding a ModSpec requirement "part" within the definition list

====
=====
----
======

The `%metadata` definition list may contain embedded
levels [added in Metanorma OGC version v1.4.3];
this is needed specifically for steps embedded within a test method.

If you need to insert a cross-reference to a component, for example referencing
a specific part of a requirement elsewhere, you can only use the block
attributes sequence (as illustrated above).

UML conceptual models.

step::: Step 2

====
----


When using ModSpec within other documents that, by default, uses another
requirements model scheme (such as non-OGC flavors), it is necessary specify the
instance with the `model` attribute.

----
======


==== Instance attributes

Attributes accepted by a ModSpec instance are as follows:

`identifier`:: (mandatory) Identifier of the requirement, such as a URI or a
URN. Plain text.
+
This must be unique in the document (as required by ModSpec), and is also used
for referencing and cross-linking between ModSpec instances.
+
NOTE: The `identifier` was previously encoded as `label` until
Metanorma OGC version v2.2.0 .

`subject`:: (optional) Subject that the model refers to. Plain text.

`obligation`:: (optional) Accepted values are one of:
`requirement`::: (default) The instance is a requirement.
`recommendation`::: The instance is a recommendation.
`permission`::: The instance is a permission.

`description`:: (optional)
The descriptive text for this instance.
+
NOTE: In a normative statement, the `description` key is treated as a synonym of
`statement`, which forms the statement of compliance itself instead of
informative, descriptive,
text. [added in mn-requirements version v0.2.1].

`target`:: (conditional: only for conformance-related models)
The "target" that is being tested against, specified with the identifier of the
requirement or requirements class. (Replaces `subject` in that context.)
+
NOTE: The `target` is only supported in definition list syntax. [added in Metanorma OGC version v2.2.0]

*** When in a conformance test (or an abstract test), specify the corresponding
identifier of the requirement that is being tested.

*** When in a conformance class, specify the corresponding identifier of the
requirement class that is being tested.

// * `model` (optional when using Metanorma OGC). Type of model. The value of `ogc`
// means using OGC ModSpec models.

Differentiated types of ModSpec models allow additional attributes.


[[generalreqt]]
==== Normative statement: requirement, recommendation, permission

Metanorma ModSpec supports the following normative statement types:

* Requirement (`requirement`)
* Recommendation (`recommendation`)
* Permission (`permission`)

The type of normative statement can be specified with using the above
values as block types, or by setting the `type` attribute of a block.

It supports the following attributes in addition to base ModSpec attributes:

`statement`:: (mandatory)
The statement to which compliance applies within this provision.
+
NOTE: Prior to mn-requirements v0.2.1, the key `description` is used.
`description` is now a synonym for `statement` in a provision
instance [added in mn-requirements version v0.2.1].

`conditions`:: (optional)
Conditions on where this requirement applies. Accepts rich text.

`part`:: (optional) A requirement can contain multiple parts of
sub-requirements. Accepts rich text. Labelled with a capital alphabetic letter.

NOTE: A part is distinct from a step (as appears in <<conftest>>): a part is a
component of a requirement, which is itself a requirement. A step is a stage in
a process of testing a requirement: it only makes sense within a test method.

`guidance`:: (optional) Guidance on how to apply the requirement. Used to avoid
numbering of notes or examples as part of the overall document. Accepts
rich text. Guidance is always rendered last in ModSpec. [added in mn-requirements version v0.1.4]

`inherit`:: (optional) A requirement can inherit from one or more requirements
(_direct dependency_ in ModSpec terms).
Accepts identifiers of other requirements: multiple values are semicolon-delimited.
Can be repeated in definition list syntax.

`indirect-dependency`:: (optional) A requirement can inherit indirectly
from one or more requirement classes, which have a different standardization target from that of the
requirement. That requirement class is used, produced, or associated with the current requirement,
but its requirements are not inherited by this requirement.
Only supported in definition list syntax. [added in Metanorma OGC version v2.2.1]

`implements`:: (optional) A requirement can implement another requirement.
Accepts identifiers of other requirements. Can be repeated in definition list
syntax [added in mn-requirements version v0.1.9].

`classification`:: (optional) Classification of this requirement.
The `classification` attribute is marked up as in the rest of Metanorma:
`key1=value1;key2=value2...`, where _value_ is either a single
string, or a comma-delimited list of values.

`requirement`, `permission`, `recommendation`:: A requirement, permission, or recommendation
contained within a requirement. The value of the element is its identifier.
Only supported in definition list syntax.

`conformance-test`, `abstract-test`, `conformance-class`,
`requirement-class` `recommendation-class`, `permission-class`::
A requirement, permission, or recommendation of those categories,
contained within a requirement. The value of the element is its identifier.
Only supported in definition list syntax. [added in mn-requirements version v0.1.6]

NOTE: `conditions`, `part` supported since [added in Metanorma OGC version v1.4.2].

NOTE: In the default rendering of ModSpec, the `statement` attribute,
descriptions are labelled as _Statement_ for requirements, recommendations,
permissions. They are left as _Description_ for all other kinds of ModSpec
instances.

[[reqt_class]]
==== Requirements class

A "`Requirements class`" is encoded as a block of `requirements_class` or using
`type` equals to `requirements_class`.

A Requirements class is cross-referenced and captioned as a
"`{Requirement} class {N}`" [added in Metanorma OGC version v0.2.11].

NOTE: Classes for Recommendations will be captioned as
"`Recommendations class {N}`", similarly for "`Requirements class {N}`" and
"`Permissions class {N}`".

Requirements classes allow the following attributes in addition to the base
ModSpec attributes:

Name:: (mandatory) Name of the requirements class should be specified as the
block caption.

`subject`:: (mandatory) The Target Type. Rendered as _Target Type_.

`inherit`:: (optional)
Dependent requirements classes. See <<generalreqt,Requirement, recommendation, permission>>.

`indirect-dependency`:: (optional)
Indirect dependent requirements classes. See <<generalreqt,Requirement, recommendation, permission>>.

`guidance`:: (optional)
Guidance on requirement class. See <<generalreqt,Requirement, recommendation, permission>>.

Embedded requirements (optional)::
Requirements contained in a class are marked up as nested requirements.

NOTE: In this example, both block attributes and definition list syntax is used;
the `inherit` attribute has two values, which are expressed in the definition list.

A requirements class can contain multiple requirements, specified with embedded
requirements.

The contents of these embedded requirements may be specified within the
requirements class, or specified outside of the requirements class (referenced
using the identifier). If the requirement is specified within a definition list,
the definition list value is interpreted as the requirement identifier.

==== Conformance class

Specified by setting the block as `conformance_class` or by using `type` as
`conformance_class`.

A Conformance class is cross-referenced and captioned as
"`Conformance class {N}`", and is otherwise rendered identically to a
"`Requirements class`" [added in Metanorma OGC version v1.0.4].

Conformance classes support the following attributes in addition to base ModSpec
attributes:

`target`:: (mandatory) Associated Requirements class. Populated with the identifier of the
Requirements class. Rendered as _Requirements Class_.

`inherit`:: (optional) Dependencies of the conformance class. Accepts multiple
values, which are the identifiers of other requirements.
See <<generalreqt,Requirement, recommendation, permission>>.

`indirect-dependency`:: (optional) Indirect dependent requirements classes. See
<<generalreqt,Requirement, recommendation, permission>>.

Conformance classes also feature:

Name:: (optional) Specified as the block caption.

Nesting:: (optional) Conformance tests contained in a conformance class are
encoded as conformance tests within the conformance class block, marked as
`conformance-test`. See <<reqt_class,Requirements class>>.

NOTE: Conformance classes do not have a Target Type (as specified in ModSpec).
If one must be encoded, it should be encoded as a classification key-value
pair.

[[conftest]]
==== Conformance test and Abstract test

A "`Conformance test`" can be "`concrete`" or "`abstract`" depending on the type
of conformance test suite (see <<OGC_08-131>>, 6.4).

The OGC author should identify whether a standard requires an "`Abstract test
suite`" or a "`Conformance test suite`" in order to decide the encoding of
"`Conformance tests`" (concrete tests) versus "`Abstract tests`".

* A conformance test is specified by creating a `conformance_test` block or
using `type` as `conformance_test`.
It is cross-referenced as "`Conformance test {N}`"

* An abstract test is specified by creating an `abstract_test` block or using
`type` as `abstract_test`, or `conformance_test` together with
`abstract=true`.
It is cross-referenced as "`Abstract test {N}`" [added in Metanorma OGC version v1.0.4].

// NOTE: Verifications for Recommendations will be captioned as
// Recommendation Tests, similarly for Requirement Tests and
// Permission Tests.

Conformance tests support the following attributes and components in addition to
base ModSpec attributes:

`target`:: The associated requirement. Populated with the identifier of the requirement.
Multiple semicolon-delimited values may be provided. Rendered as _Requirement_.

`inherit`:: (optional) Dependencies. Accepts multiple values, which are the identifiers
of other requirements.  See <<generalreqt,Requirement, recommendation, permission>>.
* `indirect-dependency` (optional). Indirect dependent requirements classes. See <<generalreqt,Requirement, recommendation, permission>>.

Components:: (optional) Components of the conformance test. Accepts rich
text. [added in Metanorma OGC version v1.4.0].
Allows the following classes:

`test-purpose`::: (optional) Purpose of the test. Rich text. Presented as _Test
Purpose_ [added in Metanorma OGC version v1.4.2]

`test-method`::: (optional) Method of the test. Rich text. Presented as _Test
Method_ [added in Metanorma OGC version v1.4.2]

`step`::: (optional) Step of the test method. Is expected to be embedded within `test-method`,
and may contain substeps of its own. Rich text. Presented as a numbered list.
added in Metanorma OGC version v1.4.2].
+
Steps can be nested, the nested list order is: _arabic_, then _alphabetic_, then
_roman_.

`test-method-type`::: (optional) Method of the test. Rich text. Presented as
_Test Method Type_ [added in Metanorma OGC version v1.4.3]

`reference`::: (optional) Purpose of the test. Rich text. Presented as _Reference_.

Test type:: The test type of a Conformance test is encoded as a `classification` key-value pair.


Conformance tests also feature:

* Name (optional). Specified as the requirement's block caption.

NOTE: Conformance Tests are excluded from the "`Table of Requirements`" in Word
output [added in Metanorma OGC version v0.2.10].

=== Cross-referencing ModSpec instances

==== General

Similar to when specifying attributes for ModSpec instances, it is preferred to refer
to other instances using identifiers, rather than the numbered labels allocated
by default.

[example]
====
In OGC, it is preferred to show the identifier of a ModSpec instance in a
cross-reference, like `http://www.example.com/req/crs/crs-uri` instead of
_Requirement Class 6_.
====


==== Referencing using predefined anchors

This can be extended to cross-references. If the anchor of the requirement is
known, a normal cross-reference can be marked up, as shown below.

.Cross-reference to a ModSpec instance using a predefined anchor
[example]
====
[source,adoc]
----
<<id1,http://www.example.com/req/crs/crs-uri>>
----

Renders (assuming that this is the 10th Requirement):

_Requirement 10_
====


==== Referencing using instance identifiers

However, not all ModSpec instances are assigned predefined anchors, especially
when using model-based generation.
It also precludes automated manipulation of the identifier base path.

For that reason, Modspec in Metanorma supports
https://www.metanorma.org/author/topics/document-format/xrefs/#anchor-aliasing[anchor aliasing]: the
identifier of the requirement can be used in cross-references as an alias of the
anchor.

Metanorma will automatically map the anchor it allocates to requirements to
identifiers, to that end: users do not need to supply the anchor alias mappings
manually.

So for a requirement such as:

[source,adoc]
----
[[id1]]
[requirement]
====
identifier:: http://www.example.com/req/crs/crs-uri
====
----

It is possible to reference a ModSpec instance using its identifier instead of
the anchor, as follows.

.Cross-reference to a ModSpec instance using its identifier, displaying the instance's name
[example]
====
[source,adoc]
----
xref:http://www.example.com/req/crs/crs-uri[]
----

Renders (assuming that this is the 10th Requirement):

_Requirement 10_
====

Metanorma treats them as fully equivalent, and will render them in the same way,
as a numbered label (_Requirement Class 6_).

NOTE: As a limitation of syntax, URIs cannot be processed correctly within
`\<< >>`. The `xref:...[]` command needs to be used instead.

To make the cross-reference render the identifier value of the instance itself,
while still hyperlinking to the correct identifier, you can specify `style=id%`
as the cross-reference text, as follows.

.Cross-reference to a ModSpec instance using its identifier, displaying the instance's identifier
[example]
====
[source,adoc]
----
xref:http://www.example.com/req/crs/crs-uri[style=id%]
----

Renders as:

`http://www.example.com/req/crs/crs-uri`
====

This will also highlight the URI text as subject to truncation, with reference
to identifier bases.

[[identifier-base]]
==== Identifier base pattern

NOTE: This functionality is first implemented in [added in mn-requirements version v0.2.1].

A ModSpec instance can be cross-referenced from other parts of the document,
with the reference text used to identify the ModSpec instance named either
according to its:

* instance label (e.g. "Requirement 3"); or
* identifier (e.g. `http://www.opengis.net/spec/waterml/2.0/req/xsd-xml-rules`)

ModSpec instances need to be assigned unique identifiers, which are typically
either
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier[URIs],
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Name[URNs] or
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL[URLs].

These identifier types utilize a hierarchical pattern. If two identifiers share
a common prefix, it means that the two identifiers can be grouped semantically
at some level.

In well-structured standards (in OGC and others), ModSpec instances often share
a common identifier prefix. For example, a defined, document-wide identifier
prefix is used as the "base" for all ModSpec identifiers.

[example]
.Document-wide identifier prefix with ModSpec instances using that prefix
====
OGC WaterML 2.0 applies a document identifier prefix:

* document identifier prefix: `http://www.opengis.net/spec/waterml/2.0`
* sample of a ModSpec instance identifier in the document:
  `http://www.opengis.net/spec/waterml/2.0/req/xsd-xml-rules`
====

When cross-referencing a ModSpec instance using its identifier, the references
can be lengthy to read.

If a document-wide identifier "base prefix" is defined, Metanorma will omit the
base prefix in the rendering of ModSpec instances when using the identifier as
reference text.

There are the following ways of specifying an identifier base prefix:

Document-wide:: The document attribute `:modspec-identifier-base:` is used
to specify the identifier base prefix for the entire document.

ModSpec class instance:: An identifier base prefix can be defined inside a
ModSpec class instance (e.g. Requirements class), using the definition list tag
`identifier-base`.

ModSpec instance:: An identifier base prefix can be defined inside a ModSpec
instance (e.g. Requirement), using the definition list tag `identifier-base`.

The behavior is specified as follows:

* If an identifier base prefix is specified document-wide:

** When a ModSpec instance or class instance is cross-referenced using its
identifier, the identifier base prefix will be removed from the identifier in
the reference text.

* If an identifier base prefix is specified on a ModSpec class instance (e.g. Requirements class):

** This identifier base prefix overrides any value specified in
`:modspec-identifier-base:`, if any.

** The identifier base prefix specified will apply to all its ModSpec instances
(e.g. Requirements in the Requirements class) unless overridden.

** When a ModSpec class instance is cross-referenced using its identifier, the
identifier base prefix will be removed from the identifier in the reference
text.

* If an identifier base prefix is specified on a ModSpec instance (e.g. Requirement):

** The identifier base prefix specified on the instance overrides all higher
level identifier base prefixes;

** The identifier base prefix specified on the instance's class (e.g. Requirements class)
overrides any value specified in `:modspec-identifier-base:`, if any;

** When the instance is cross-referenced using its identifier, the
identifier base prefix will be removed from the identifier in the reference
text.

NOTE: An identifier base specified on a requirement applies to all ModSpec
requirement cross-references rendered within that requirement. The identifier base
truncation is applied to cross-references rendered as just the identifier (`style=id%`),
but it is also applied to the identifiers incorporated inside of normal cross-references,
and to the identifier labels of requirements.

=== Rendering of ModSpec instances

ModSpec instances are rendered in a table format.

NOTE: This rendering method is consistent with prior OGC ModSpec practice.

* For HTML rendering, the CSS class of the ModSpec specification table is the
`type` attribute of the requirement.
+
--
The following types are recognised:

** No value for Requirements
** `conformance_test` for Conformance tests
** `abstract_test` for Abstract tests
** `requirements_class` for Requirements classes
** `conformance_class` for Conformance classes

NOTE: The default CSS class currently assigned for HTML rendering is `recommend`.
--

* The heading of the table (spanning two columns) is its name (the role
or style of the requirement, e.g. `[permission]` or `[.permission]`), optionally
followed by its title (the caption of the requirement, e.g. `.Title`).

* The title of the table (spanning two columns) is its `identifier` attribute.

* The initial rows of the body of the table give metadata about the requirement.
They include:

** The `obligation` attribute of the requirement, if given: _Obligation_
followed by the attribute value

** The `subject` attribute of the requirement, if given: _Subject_, followed by the attribute.
The subject attribute can be marked up as a cross-reference
to another requirement given in the same document. If there are multiple values of the subject,
they are semicolon delimited [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.10.4].

** The `inherit` attribute of the requirement, if given: _Dependency_ followed
by the attribute value. If there are multiple values of the attribute,
they are semicolon delimited.

** The `indirect-dependency` attribute of the requirement, if given:
_Indirect Dependency_ followed by the attribute value. If there are multiple
values of the attribute, they are semicolon delimited.

** The `classification` attributes of the requirement, if given: the
classification tag (in capitals), followed by the classification value.

* The remaining rows of the requirement are the remaining components of the
requirement, encoded as table rows instead of as a definition table (as they are
by default in Metanorma).

** These include the explicit `component` components of the
requirement [added in Metanorma OGC version v1.4.0],
which capture internal components of the requirement defined in ModSpec.
+
These are divided into two categories:

*** Components with a `class` attribute other than `part` are
extracted in order, with the class name normalised (title case), followed by the component contents.
So a component with a `class` attribute of `conditions` will be rendered as
_Conditions_ followed by the component contents. In the foregoing, we have seen components defined
in ModSpec: `test-purpose, test-method, test-method-type, conditions, reference`. However the block attribute
syntax allows open-ended component names.

*** Components with the `class` attribute `part` are extracted and presented in
order: each Part is rendered as an incrementing capital letter (_A_, _B_, _C_
and so on), followed by the component contents. Any cross-references to part components
will automatically be labelled with the identifier of their parent requirement, followed by their ordinal
letter.

** Components can include descriptive text (`description`), which is interleaved with
other components.

** Components can include open blocks marked with role attributes. That includes the
legacy Metanorma components:

*** `[.specification]`
*** `[.measurement-target]`
*** `[.verification]`
*** `[.import]`


== Render UML models

=== Render UML models with LutaML

OGC uses the Metanorma toolchain for publishing standards. The steps involved in
transforming UML models into an MDS can be simplified as the conversion from
UML models into Metanorma syntax.
This clause describes in detail how this conversion step is performed.

OGC (through Testbed-17) has developed an automated workflow that provides a
default UML rendering template set to render each UML class and package in the
same way. This workflow uses the LutaML plugin to render the UML
model's contents into document elements, called the
`[lutaml_uml_datamodel_description]` block.

The `[lutaml_uml_datamodel_description]` block is used to iterate through a
sequence of UML packages, rendering each in a consistent way.
The rendering template for each type of UML element is predefined. Users do not
have to supply their own template text unless overriding is needed.

NOTE: LutaML uses Liquid as its templating language.

[[exporting-ea-xmi]]
=== Exporting an MDS-readable model from EA

In order to make its information accessible to the MDA process, the UML models
and associated information needs to be exported into an interoperable format.

Enterprise Architect version 16 onwards uses a proprietary binary format called
`qea`, which is not readable outside of the application itself.

The interoperable format used in the OGC MDS process is the OMG UML format
exported as OMG XMI (XML Model Interchange) (<<OMG_XMI>>) format, as an XML file
with the extension of `xmi`.

To export a UML Package (top-level package or one of the packages), first
select the UML Package to be exported, then click on "Publish As..." as shown
in <<fig-ea-publish-as>>.

[[fig-ea-publish-as]]
.Location of the "Publish As..." button
image::ea-publish-as.png[]

Clicking on the "Publish As..." button opens a dialog box with the options
shown in <<fig-ea-export-options>>.

[[fig-ea-export-options]]
.Generation options for an XMI that works with Metanorma
image::ea-generate-model.png[]

The user will need to export the file with the following configuration set:

* Filename change the file extension to use `.xmi` in the "..." dialog box
* XML Type set to "UML 2.4.1 (XMI 2.4.2)"
* Check the following boxes in "General Options":
** Export Diagrams
** Format XML Output
** Generate Diagram Images, set Format to "SVG"
* Click on "Export"

NOTE: The Format "SVG" option is supported from EA version 16.1. Prior to 16.1,
EMF was the only vector image format.

When these steps are followed the exported XMI will be at the path specified,
ready to serve as input for the MDS process.

The resulting output will be placed in the selected directory as seen in
<<ea-export-images-dir>>. Note that the UML diagrams will be exported
under a new directory called `Images/` under the selected directory.

[[ea-export-images-dir]]
.Example of EA-exported XMI with EMF images

----
====

For typical UML diagrams, the "SVG" format exports into `*.svg` files, and work
best since they are vector images. SVG images allow for perfect scaling in PDF
output and in HTML web browsers.

However, the EA SVG export functionality can occasionally fail to produce
accurate results, especially for complex UML diagrams that involve custom
relationships and lines.

.Example of failed EA exported SVG
====
.EA-generated SVG file containing inaccurate layout
image::ea-exported-image-svg.svg[]

.EA-generated PNG file with correct layout

In this case, the follow additional steps will also export PNG images in the
same directory:

* Filename change the file extension to use `.xmi` in the "..." dialog box
* XML Type set to "UML 2.4.1 (XMI 2.4.2)"
* Check the following boxes in "General Options":
** Export Diagrams
** Format XML Output
** Generate Diagram Images, set Format to "PNG"
* Click on "Export"

If you specify the same location for exporting PNG images, they will
be placed alongside the previously generated SVG images as shown in
<<ea-export-images-dir-png>>

[source,asciidoc,subs=none]
----
[lutaml&#x5f;uml_datamodel_description,path/to/example.xmi]
--
--
----

`lutaml_uml_datamodel_description` declares the type of this block;
`path/to/example.xmi` is the path to the OMG XMI file.

This command generates a Metanorma representation of the UML elements contained
in the XMI file `path/to/example.xmi`.

By default, this block will iterate through the entire XMI file:

* Including all diagrams as figures in the MDS

* Rendering all UML elements hierarchically in the order of Package, Classes,
Attributes, Associations, etc.


=== Configuration file

==== General

The behavior of the `lutaml_uml_datamodel_description` can be customized through
providing a configuration file in YAML, as shown in
<<lutaml_uml_datamodel_description_config>>.

[[lutaml_uml_datamodel_description_config]]
.Configuring behavior of the `lutaml_uml_datamodel_description` block
[source,asciidoc,subs=none]
----
[lutaml&#x5f;uml_datamodel_description,path/to/example.xmi,config.yaml]
--
--
----

`config.yaml` is the path to a YAML config file for the
`lutaml_uml_datamodel_description` block.

The `config.yaml` parameter is optional. The nominated YAML file
specifies which packages to process in the command, in which order; rendering
style instructions; and the location of the root package.

The syntax of the YAML file is described in
<<lutaml_uml_datamodel_description_yaml_config>>.

[[lutaml_uml_datamodel_description_yaml_config]]

----
<1> The `packages` key.
<2> The `render_style` key.
<3> The `section_depth` key.
<4> The `package_root_level` key.

All keys in the configuration files are optional.


==== Package inclusion

The `packages` key accepts an array of package name specifications that
describes which packages to be included or excluded. The filter execution order
is in the sequence of specification.

Specifically, any package that matches the given pattern (supporting regular
expression matches) will be included in output.

[example]
The regular expression "three" will only match the package name "three", which
will be included in the rendered output.

[example]
The regular expression `Package *` will match "Package 1", "Package X" and
"Package This-And-That".

To exclude packages, a syntax of `skip: {name}` is used for the package name
specification. If a package was included in one of the matches, a skip rule that
matches will cause that package to be skipped.

[example]
The specification "skip: four" will specifically skip the package named "four"
even if it was included in one of the matches prior to the skip rule.

==== Rendering style

===== General

The `render_style` value indicates the automated generation style to be used.

The generation style affects:

* the clause hierarchical structure;
* the content rendered from the generated UML models.


There are 3 types of UML rendering styles:

* `default`: the default manner to render UML packages and classes in an OGC
deliverable;

* `entity_list`: the entity list style provides a high level summary of all
elements in a package;

* `data_dictionary`: the data dictionary style provides detailed definitions to
describe elements in a package.

In practice, the entity list and the data dictionary styles are commonly meant
to be used together in a single document.
This combination should only used when there is an unexcusable need to deviate
from the default style, such as for:

* highly-modularized documents, where models are packaged in multiple modules;

* backwards compatibility for deliverables that have previously adopted
the entity list + data dictionary structure;

* models with a deep hierarchy, which the default style would lead to very
deep clause hierarchies.

[example]
The default style is used for <<OGC_20-040r3>>.

[example]
The entity list + data dictionary style is used for <<OGC_20-010>>.


===== Default style

The default style is considered the style to use for new MDS documents
as it provides an OGC accepted order and rendering of UML components.

In the default style, the following steps are taken:

. For every UML package ("package-name"):

.. Render an overview subclause for the package, titled "{package-name} overview",
with the following content:

... If this package contains subpackages, render the following:

**** "The {package-name} package is organized into {sub-package-count} packages:"
**** Each sub-package is then listed out

... Figures included in the top-most level of the package are rendered.

.. For every sub-packages, recurse as per step 1.

.. Render defining tables for every element in this package (in the order of
Class / Interface / Union / DataType) according to this list of information:

*** Name
*** Definition
*** Stereotype
*** Inheritance from (optional)
*** Generalization of (optional)
*** Abstract
*** Associations: Association with; Obligation; Maximum occurrence; Provides
*** Public attributes: Name; Definition; Derived; Obligation; Maximum occurrence; Data type
*** Constraints


An example of the `default` style is shown in <<render-style-default>>.

.Rendering style `default` used in <<OGC_20-040r3>> (ISO 19170)
image::mn-dggs-auto-mapping.png[]



===== Entity list style

The entity list style provides an overview listing of all UML components within
a UML package. It provides a high-level overview of the UML package and is meant
to be used together with the data dictionary style.

This style was originally developed from <<OGC_20-010>> and is only recommended
for MDS experts to tailor the MDS experience.


An example of the `entity_list` style is shown in <<render-style-entity-list-toc>>
and <<render-style-entity-list-contents>>.

[[render-style-entity-list-contents]]
.Rendering style `entity_list` body contents used in <<OGC_20-010>>
image::mn-uml-render-entity-list-content.png[]



===== Data dictionary style

The data dictionary style provides a detailed listing of all UML components
within a UML package. It provides a detailed-level inspection of the UML package
and is meant to be used together with the entity list style.

This style was originally developed from <<OGC_20-010>> and is only recommended
for MDS experts to tailor the MDS experience.

An example of the `data_dictionary` style is shown in
<<render-style-data-dictionary-toc>>,
<<render-style-data-dictionary-content-1>>,
<<render-style-data-dictionary-content-2>>.

.Rendering style `data_dictionary` body content part 2 used in <<OGC_20-010>>
image::mn-uml-render-data-dictionary-content-2.png[]


==== Section depth

The `section_depth` value specifies the clause depth intended for the automated
rendering to occur in Metanorma.

[example]
The `section_depth` value of 2 specifies that the location of the
`lutaml_uml_datamodel_description` command is at the second level of depth, used
to maintain the hierarchy of generated AsciiDoc sections.


==== Package root depth

The `package_root_depth` value indicates the depth of the automated inclusion
process from the root UML package block (an OMG XMI file starts with a UML
package as root).

[example]
The `package_root_level` value of 2 specifies that the automatic inclusion
iterative process starts with UML packages at depth 2 of the XMI.


=== Customization options

==== General

The `[lutaml_uml_datamodel_description]` block allows specification of
multiple overriding hooks for users to insert content within
the automated rendering process.

==== Diagrams

The `[.diagram_include_block]` block inside `[lutaml_uml_datamodel_description]`
is used to import images generated from EA into the automated rendering process.

The process described <<exporting-ea-xmi>> allows extraction of UML diagrams
directly from EA. These UML diagrams however exported into image files named
according to an EA-proprietary unique ID, such as
`EAID_40625194_4483_46b2_80CF_2756F08865D8.svg`, which are difficult to work
with.

The `[.diagram_include_block]` block allows `[lutaml_uml_datamodel_description]`
to find the correct figure files through this syntax:

.Including diagrams in the `lutaml_uml_datamodel_description` block
[source,asciidoc]
----
[.diagram_include_block, base_path="working-directory/Images", format="svg"] <1>
....
Text <2>
....
----
<1> `base_path` specifies the path of the EA-generated images, `format`
specifies the file extension of the EA-generated images.
<2> Metanorma AsciiDoc text prior to appearance of the image.

The `base_path` parameter is a mandatory value that specifies the
path of the EA-generated images. The path here is relative to the source file
location where the `[lutaml_uml_datamodel_description]` block is defined.

For example, this is how a typical OGC MDS directory looks like:

.Example of OGC MDS document directory with SVG images
====
----
+- sources/
  +- images/
  +- document.adoc
  +- model/
    +- export.xmi
    +- UML_EA.dtd

      +- EAID_76FDCDFB_19E5_47b6_9D21_E6450814059F.svg
----
====

Using this OGC MDS directory, the following block specification will
include the EA-generated images.

====
[source,asciidoc]
----
[.diagram_include_block, base_path="model/Images", format="svg"]
....
....
----
====

If the EA-generated SVG images are generated with undesired artefacts, the `png`
format option can be used. Simply re-generate the images using the "PNG" output
format in EA in the same directory.

====



==== Before and after blocks

The `[.before]` and `[.after]` blocks in the
`[lutaml_uml_datamodel_description]` block allows specifying text before or
after every described UML class.

When used by itself, it means that this block applies before or after all
packages have been iterated through (`[.before]`, `[.after]`).

A `package` parameter can be given to this block to specify that the block only
applies to before or after a particular package in the loop (`[.before,
package="Another"]`, `[.after, package="CityGML"]`).

.Example of using before and after blocks
====
[source,adoc]
----
[.before]
....
Text applies before first package is inspected.
....

[.before, package="CityGML"]
....
Text applies immediately before the CityGML package is inspected.
....

[.after, package="CityGML"]
....
Text applies immediately after the CityGML package is inspected.
....

[.after]
....
Text applies after all packages have been inspected.
....
----
====

==== Include block

The include block allows dynamic insertion of an external file according
to the UML package name being inspected.

The syntax is:

[source,adoc]
----
[.include_block, position="before", base_path="requirements/requirements_class_"]
--
--
----

Where,

`base_path`:: specifies where to find the dynamic file being inserted;
`position=`:: (optional) specifies either `before` or `after`;
`package=`:: (optional) specifies the UML package match condition.

NOTE: Only `before` and `after` are currently defined as values for `position`.

To use the include block it is necessary to know how the package name is
translated into a file name, which file is to be included.

The package name to file name conversion takes these steps:

. The package name is lowercased;

. The symbols `-`, `:` and ` ` (whitespace) is converted into `_`;

. The resulting name is prefixed with an underscore (`_`), appended with the
`.adoc` or `.liquid` extension, and the specified `base_path=`.

For example, the UML package name of "MUDDI Core: packages" will be transformed
into `{base_path}_muddi_core__packages.[adoc|liquid]`.

The `include_block` is useful for including per UML package content, such as
ModSpec requirements, conformance tests and structured content.

[example]
====
[.include_block, base_path="spec/fixtures"]
....
This is additional text that will be included after the inclusion of
the `spec/fixtures/{include_package_name}` file for every UML package evaluated.
....

[.include_block, package="Another", base_path="spec/fixtures"]
....
This is additional text that will be included after the inclusion of
the `spec/fixtures/{include_package_name}` file before the `Another` package.
....
====


==== Package block

The `[.package_text]` block in the `[lutaml_uml_datamodel_description]` block
allows specifying a block to insert at a particular clause index.

The `[.package_text]` block can take the following forms.

To specify text to be interpolated in predefined positions within each package,
use the `position=` and `package=` parameters (`[.package_text,
position="after", package="Another"]`).

The syntax is:

[source,adoc]
----
[.package_text, index="1", position="before", package="Another"]
--
--
----

Where,

`package=`:: specifies the UML package match condition;
`position=`:: (optional) specifies either `before` or `after`;
`index=`:: (optional) if there are multiple `package_text` blocks, define the
order of the inserted blocks.

NOTE: Only `before` and `after` are currently defined as values for `position`.

The `package_block` is useful for injecting particular texts or files
to the automatically generated content.

[example]
====
[source,adoc,subs=none]
----
[.package_text, index="1", position="before", package="Common Spatio-temporal Classes"]
....
include::clause_7_1_common.adoc[]
....
----

----
[.package_text, index="2", position="before", package="Temporal and Zonal Geometry"]

=== Manual rendering (advanced)

For the advanced user who wishes to access data elements beyond the automated
process, LutaML provides the `[lutaml]` command that can be used individually to
build up an MDS.

NOTE: Using the `[lutaml]` command for MDS will be highly repetitive and
require in-depth understand of Liquid templating.

<<package_lutaml>> shows an instance of the `[lutaml]` command in Metanorma,
which instructs LutaML to process the file in `path/to/file.xmi`, and
pass the results of the parse into the object `package`.

The body of the command then iterates through the contents of `package`, and
generates Metanorma AsciiDoc using values from the variable.

[[package_lutaml]]
.Rendering of a UML package under LutaML
[source,asciidoc,subs=none]
----
[&#x200c;lutaml,path/to/filelocation.xmi,package]

image::{{ base_path }}/{{ diagram.xmi_id }}.{{ format | default: 'png' }}[]

{% if diagram.definition %}
{{ diagram.definition | html2adoc }}
{% endif %}
{% endfor %}
--
----

* The directives in `{% ... %}` are Liquid processing directives, including
loops and conditionals.

* The variables referenced in the directives, and invoked through
`{&#x200c;{ ... }}`, are attributes parsed by LutaML from the given source files. For
example, `package.diagrams` is the list of all diagrams under the current
package, and `diagram` is a loop variable containing the parsed information for
one such diagram.

* The variable `diagram` contains attributes of its own which LutaML has parsed;
the XMI ID attribute for the diagram,

** `{&#x200c;{ diagram.xmi_id }}` is used in conjunction with the LutaML
parameter `{&#x200c;{ image_base_path }}` in order to define the file location
of the associated image file.

** `{&#x200c;{ diagram.xmi_id }}` is also used with the prefix `figure-` to
define the anchor for the image (`[[...]]`), to be used in cross-references.

** The markup `.{&#x200c;{ diagram.name }}` is used to insert the name attribute
of the diagram as the image caption.



// === Linking the XMI file to Metanorma

// The automatic inclusion behavior is implemented by the
// `lutaml_uml_datamodel_description` command with a YAML
// configuration file using the following steps:

// . In every UML package of the model file, investigate every UML class

// . If the UML package contains diagrams (in the `xmi-19170-only/Images` folder),
//   include them all before content generation.

// . If there is a requirements Metanorma AsciiDoc file that uses the current UML
//   package's name, include the file as content before content generation.

// . Render the UML class into the default UML representation template
//   (embedded in LutaML).
