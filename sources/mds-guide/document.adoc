== Introduction

The MDS process described in <<OGC_21-035r1>> enables standardized documentation
of conceptual models in UML, which could be platform-independent models (PIMs)
or platform-specific models (PSMs).

In the past, UML modeling activity and the OGC authoring process used
disparate tools, causing OGC authors and editors much pain in the
synchronization of changes originating from either activity.

As studied in OGC Testbed-17, <<OGC_21-035r1>> has investigated several options
in model-driven authoring, in which the OGC MUDDI SWG has decided to adopt
and sponsor development of a particular approach that utilizes the following
combination of tools:

* Enterprise Architect (from Sparx Systems) in the creation and maintenance of
UML models, and

* Metanorma (from Ribose) in the authoring of OGC deliverables.

This combination of tools can provide a streamlined development environment
for OGC working groups developing conceptual model standards:

* By maintaining standards content in the model, simplifying and decoupling
  the model maintenance process is possible.

* Storing annotations and guidance about the model together
  with the actual model enables a single source of truth that can streamline the
  standards authoring process.

This document is meant to describe best practices that enable achievement
of these benefits.


== Technology and tools

=== General

Best practices described in this document are meant for OGC working group
participants fluent in the development of:

* UML conceptual models
* OGC authoring practices

This document does not delve into details in those areas -- readers may wish to
attempt further introductory for the full understanding of the practices
described.

=== UML conceptual models

==== General

<<ISO-IEC_19501>> specifies the UML modelling language, a graphical language for
visualizing, specifying, constructing, and documenting the artifacts of a
software-intensive system.

UML specifies a set of methodologies for developing technical artifacts used in
the design of a software system, ranging from business processes and system
functions to programming language statements, database schemas, and reusable
software components.
UML is often used to develop domain-specific models (e.g., geospatial
information) used in system development.

The usage of UML in MDS lies with two aspects:

* For model definition, the definition of information models and their
  relationships, that contain human- and machine-readable components; and

* For class diagrams, the visual arrangement of UML class relationships intended
  for human consumption only.


==== Modeling elements

NOTE: A detailed description on UML modelling capabilities can be found
in <<OGC_21-035r1,clause=5.1>>.

UML provides 3 basic modeling elements:

Package:: A package is a defined collection of interrelated classes.
Class:: A class is an abstract representation of a real-world object, which
contains properties.
Property:: A property represents an aspect of a class.

UML allows additional modeling extensions in the following 3 ways:

Stereotype:: A defined set of properties that a Class can adopt as a whole,
commonly representing a platform-specific or domain-specific concern.
More than one stereotype can be adopted by a single Class.

Tagged Value:: A structured key-value pair defined for a UML element, allowing
the attachment of additional (custom) information to the UML element.

Constraint:: A string that limits possible value assignments to the property.

The UML "Profile" is another mechanism that allows for the easy application
of stereotypes.

Profile:: A profile contains multiple UML stereotypes that a UML model
can adopt.

=== UML profiles for geospatial models

==== General

A number of common UML profiles are used for geospatial UML modeling.


==== UML Standard Profile

The UML Standard Profile is provided by the UML standard (<<OMG_UML>>).

It provides the following stereotypes for Classes:

«Auxiliary»:: A class that supports another class.
«Focus»:: A class that specifies core logic or control with auxiliary classes that provide subordinate mechanisms.
«ImplementationClass»:: An implementation class of a class.
«Metaclass»:: A UML element that is meant to be extended.
«Realization»:: A realization of an abstract UML element.
«Specification»:: A specialization of a UML element.
«Type»:: A data type.
«Utility»:: A class that supports functionality of more than one class.


==== GML

In the geospatial domain, stereotypes from the GML profile (<<OGC_20-010>>) are
often applied to geospatial UML elements.

The GML profile provides the following Stereotypes that apply to Classes:

«CodeList»:: A list of enumerated codes. Practically an enumeration.
«DataType»:: A basic type of information.
«FeatureType»:: A type of feature.
«Type»:: A type of information.
«Union»:: A union of two classes.

The GML profile provides the following Stereotypes that apply to Properties:

«property»:: A basic property.


==== ISO 19100-series profile: Conceptual schema language (ISO 19103:2015)

<<ISO_19103>> provides rules and guidelines for the use of a conceptual schema
language to model geographic information, and specifies a profile of UML.

It includes 6 stereotypes:

«Interface»:: (formerly `«Type»`) is an abstract classifier with operations,
attributes and associations, which can only inherit from or be inherited by
other interfaces (or types).

«DataType»:: is a set of properties that lack identity (independent existence
and the possibility of side effects). A data type is a classifier with no
operations, whose primary purpose is to hold information.

«Union»:: is a type consisting of one and only one of several alternative
datatypes (listed as member attributes); this is similar to a discriminated
union in many programming languages.

«Enumeration»:: is a fixed list of valid identifiers of named literal values.
Attributes whose range type is an enumeration may only take values from the
fixed list.

«CodeList»:: is a flexible enumeration that uses string values for expressing
a list of potential values. The allowed values are often held and managed using
an online register.

«Leaf»:: is a package that contains only classes (packages are disallowed).

The <<ISO_19103>> profile of UML also includes one tagged value:

* `codeList`, applies to stereotype `«CodeList»`: Code lists managed by a single
external authority may carry a tagged value "`codeList`" whose value references
the actual external code list. If the tagged value is set, only values from the
referenced code list are valid.


The <<ISO_19103>> profile of UML is summarized in <<fig11>>.

[[fig11]]
.<<ISO_19103>> stereotypes and keywords
image::iso-19103-stereotypes.png[]


==== ISO 19100-series profile: Rules for application schema (ISO 19109:2015)

<<ISO_19109>> defines rules for creating and documenting application schemas
(conceptual schemas for data required by one or more applications), including
principles for the definition of features, a fundamental unit of geographic
information. As part of the general rules for application schemas it specifies
the "`General Feature Model`" (GFM), the meta-model for application schemas.

The <<ISO_19109>> profile of UML that is used as the conceptual schema language
for application schemas adds 2 stereotypes and 3 tagged values.

«ApplicationSchema»:: (package) stereotype
«FeatureType»:: (class) stereotype

The following 3 tagged values apply to both of these stereotypes:

designation::
Natural language designator for the element to complement the name. Optional,
with multiple designations allowed in order to support different languages.

definition::
Concise definition of the element. One definition is mandatory. Additional
definitions can be provided in multiple languages if required.

description::
Description of the element, including information beyond that required for
concise definition but which may assist in understanding its scope and
application. Optional, with multiple descriptions allowed in order to support
different languages.

The <<ISO_19109>> profile of UML is summarized in <<fig12>>:

[[fig12]]
.Summary of <<ISO_19109>> profile of UML
image::iso-19109-uml-profile.png[]


==== ISO 19118:2011 Geographic information -- Encoding

<<ISO_19118>> specifies the requirements for defining encoding rules for use for
the interchange of data that conform to the geographic information in the set of
International Standards known as the "ISO 19100 series". It specifies
requirements for creating encoding rules based on UML schemas, requirements for
creating encoding services, and requirements for XML-based encoding rules for
neutral interchange of data. It specifies a profile of UML that includes eight
stereotypes, two of which are not previously defined similarly by either
<<ISO_19103>> or <<ISO_19109>>.

The profile provides the following stereotypes for Classes:

«BasicType»:: "`Defines a basic data type that has defined a canonical encoding.`" (<<ISO_19118,clause="C.2.1.2">>)
+
--
Additionally stated is that:
"`This canonical encoding may define how to represent values of the type as bits
in a memory location or as characters in a textual encoding. Examples of simple
types are integer, float and string.`"

NOTE: For translation into XML, <<ISO_19118,clause="C.5.2.1.1">> states: "`A
class stereotyped `«BasicType»` shall be converted to a simpleType declaration
in XML Schema. Any of the data types defined in XML Schema can be used as
building blocks to define user-defined basic types. The encoding of the basic
types shall follow the canonical representation defined in XML Schema Part 2:
Datatypes (<<W3C_XML2>>).`"

NOTE: The different types are not clearly defined in <<ISO_19103_2005>> and neither is
the `«BasicType»` stereotype used. The following declarations, therefore, follow
a subset of the data type definitions in <<W3C_XML2>>. Declared
are the types: Number, Integer, Decimal, Real, Vector, Character,
CharacterString, Date, Time, DateTime, Boolean, Logical, Probability, Binary,
and UnlimitedInteger (where the symbol "`*`" is used to represent the infinite
value).
--

«Interface»:: "`Defines a service interface and shall not be encoded.`" (<<ISO_19118,clause="C.2.1.2">>)
+
--
This definition is inconsistent with that of the subsequently
published <<ISO_19103>>. While this inconsistency may be useful in contexts
where it is clear which definition applies, in general it is undesirable to
overload the meanings of stereotypes within the OGC community, and in particular
thereby coming into conflict with a stereotype specified in <<ISO_19103>>.

While the stereotype `«Interface»` as defined in <<ISO_19118>> can be (and is
here) subsequently ignored, the stereotype `«BasicType»` is used in the
CityGML 3.0 Conceptual Model where it results in difficulties given its tie to a
specific encoding technology -- XML Schema -- and thus lack of true platform
independence. The CityGML 3.0 Conceptual Model redefines the stereotype
`«BasicType»` to mean "`defines a basic data type`", which is both circular and
differs from that of <<ISO_19118>>.
--


=== OGC authoring practices

==== Sparx Systems Enterprise Architect (EA)

<<SSEA>> is widely used in OGC and ISO/TC 211 for the authoring and management
of UML models.

EA Version 16 is a Windows application, it can be run in 32-bit or 64-bit mode
on Windows, and can be run on other platforms using CrossOver (which is based on
WINE technology) with 32-bit emulation.


==== Metanorma for OGC

<<MN>> is an open-source framework for creating and publishing standardization
artifacts with the focus on semantic authoring and flexible output support.

"`Metanorma for OGC`" is an OGC-specific implementation that has been
approved as an official way to publish new OGC Standard documents since
2021-09-17. Metanorma-based document templates have been approved by the OGC
Document SubCommittee on 2022-02-25.

Metanorma for OGC documents are created in the Metanorma AsciiDoc format.
Metanorma AsciiDoc is a textual syntax for preparing a <<ISO_36100>> compliant
document model tree which can be rendered in a variety of presentation formats.

At its core, Metanorma provides a model-based documentation system and
prioritizes automation, through the following features:

* a set of standard document metamodels (according to <<ISO_36100>>) that allows
  different standardization bodies to create their own standardized deliverable
  model, which in turn relies on the following standardized models:

** <<ISO_36200>> standards metadata specification metamodels;
** <<ISO_690>> bibliographic and citation item models;
** <<ISO_10241-1>> and <<ISO_704>> concept organization and terminology models;

* a standard XML serialization (<<ISO_36300>>) for machine-readable
  standardization documents; and

* an open-source publishing toolchain that enables editors of standard documents
  to handle their documents from authoring to publishing in an end-to-end,
  "`author-to-publish`" fashion.

For OGC usage, it provides the following additional features:

* Rendering outputs in PDF, HTML, Microsoft Word, and <<ISO_36100>> XML formats;

* Support for specification of OGC Standards metadata, including document types,
  stages, identifiers and authorship;

* Support for specification of OGC ModSpec (<<OGC_08-131>>) model instances
  through a specialized syntax.

* For OGC MDS usage, Metanorma supports navigation for information models in the
  OMG UML/XMI format (OMG UML within OMG XMI in XML format, <<OMG_UML>>,
  <<OMG_XMI>>) generated from Enterprise Architect, through the LutaML information
  model parser.

<<fig151>> shows the range of models used in Metanorma, including the OGC-specific
use of OGC ModSpec.

== Basics of Enterprise Architect

=== Launch screen

Once the EA application is launched with a model file, the screen is shown as in
<<fig-ea-launch>>.

[[fig-ea-launch]]
.Launch screen of Enterprise Architect
image::ea-intro-first-launch.png[]

There are 4 basic panes in this screen:

* Browser: where the UML packages, models and properties are shown and can
be navigated.

* Main pane: the area in the middle (labelled with the tab "Start Page").
It is typically used to show and work with diagrams.

* Properties: shows all properties and attributes of the selected UML element,
whether it is a figure, package, class or property.

* Notes: shows textual annotations made to the selected UML element.


Relevant best practices:

* In the Notes pane, enter plain text in the Metanorma AsciiDoc format.
While the pane supports rich-text entry, the text is encoded in HTML based on
the antiquated Microsoft RTF format, and makes it difficult to perform any
post processing upon extraction.


=== Using the Browser pane

The top-level package in the Enterprise Architect file can be expanded
and drilled-down into.

<<fig-first-file>> shows how the hierarchy looks like.

[[fig-first-file]]
.Example of expanding the UML model hierarchy (source: MUDDI)
image::ea-intro-first-file.png[]

[[fig-browser-item-types]]
.Browser item types
image::ea-browser-item-types.png[]


In the Browser, there are 4 (basic) types of elements seen in its hierarchy
(see <<fig-browser-item-types>>):

* Packages: UML packages.

** The top-level item shown in <<fig-first-file>> is a UML package called "Model".

** The second item is a UML package called "Conceptual Model".

* Diagrams: UML diagrams.

** The 3rd and 4th items named: "fig: MUDDI Conceptual Model" and "MUDDI Core Conceptual Model"
are figures.

* Classes: UML classes.

** The 5th to 8th items are all UML classes.

* Property: UML element property.

** The 9th to 10th items are UML properties that belong to the class "Annotation".


=== Diagrams

When opening a diagram from the Browser pane, a tab will be opened in the middle
pane showing the UML diagram (see <<fig-ea-figure-open>>).

[[fig-ea-figure-open]]
.UML diagram in EA
image::ea-figure-open.png[]

NOTE: The UML diagram can be zoomed in via the "View" action in the ribbon tab.

When a diagram is selected in the Browser, the Properties and Notes panes
will be changed to reflect information about the selected diagram.

The MDS process uses the following information from an EA UML Diagram:

* Graphics of the diagram: is exported in the vector format and included
in the OGC deliverable.

* Title of the diagram: as the caption of the Figure in the OGC deliverable.

* Notes of the diagram: contents of the Notes (seen in the Notes pane) is
used as a "NOTE to Figure" in the OGC deliverable.

The title of the diagram is edited within the Properties pane when
the diagram is selected. See <<fig-ea-figure-property>>.

Model authors commonly create multiple diagrams but only wish to selectively
include diagrams in the MDS process.

To indicate to the MDS process that a diagram is to be included, the title
must be prefixed with `fig: ` ("fig:" with a space).

Diagrams that are not prefixed with `fig: ` will not be included in the MDS
process.


[[fig-ea-figure-property]]
.EA Diagram Properties pane
image::ea-figure-property.png[]



=== Packages

On selection of a UML Package, the Properties and Notes panes will reflect the
selected item.

The MDS process incorporates information of the UML Package, including:

* Notes of the UML Package: as the definition (description) of the UML Package (as
in the Notes pane) (see <<fig-ea-package-note>>).

* Name of the UML Package: name of the UML Package is used as the clause heading
in the OGC deliverable (see <<fig-ea-package-properties>>).

* Package details:

** URI: Identifier in URI format.

** "Visibility": `Public`, `Private`, `Protected` or `Package` visibility.

[[fig-ea-package-properties]]
.EA UML package Properties pane
image::ea-package-properties.png[]



=== Classes

On selection of a UML Class in the Browser pane, the Properties
and Notes panes will reflect the selected item.

The MDS process heavily incorporates information of the UML Class, including:

* Notes of the UML class: as the definition (description) of the UML Class (as
in the Notes pane) (see <<fig-ea-class-note>>).

* Name of the UML class: name of the UML class, used as a clause heading in the
OGC deliverable (see <<fig-ea-class-property>>).

* Stereotype of the UML class: stereotype of the UML class, wrapped with `«` and
`»` characters in the OGC deliverable.

* Class properties:

** "Abstract" status: whether it is an Abstract class

** "Visibility": `Public`, `Private`, `Protected` or `Package` visibility


[[fig-ea-class-note]]

[[fig-ea-class-property]]
.EA UML class Properties pane
image::ea-class-property.png[]

To set Stereotypes, click on the "..." to the right of the Stereotypes row
in the Properties pane. A dialog box will be opened to allow selection of
Stereotypes.

For geospatial modeling, EA supports setting Stereotypes from the following
profiles:

* UML Standard Profile (see <<fig-ea-stereotypes-uml>>)

* GML Profile (see <<fig-ea-stereotypes-gml>>)

=== Properties

On selection of a UML Property (under a UML Class), the Properties
and Notes panes will reflect the selected item.

The MDS process heavily incorporates information of the UML Property, including:

* Notes of the UML Property: as the definition (description) of the UML Property (as
in the Notes pane) (see <<fig-ea-property-note>>).

* Name of the UML Property: name of the UML Property, used as a clause heading in the
OGC deliverable (see <<fig-ea-property-properties>>).

* Stereotype of the UML Property: stereotype of the UML Property, wrapped with `«` and
`»` characters in the OGC deliverable.

* Property details:

** Initial value: default value if not specified.

** Multiplicity: `0`, `1`, `0..1`, `0..*`, `1..*`, `*`

image::ea-property-properties.png[]


=== Exporting into XMI

Enterprise Architect version 16 onwards uses a proprietary binary format called
`qea`, which is not readable outside of the application itself.

In order to make its information accessible to the MDA process, the UML models
and associated information needs to be exported into an interoperable format.

That format is the OMG UML format exported as OMG XMI (XML Model Interchange)
format, as an XML file with the extension of `xmi`,

To export a UML Package (top-level package or one of the packages), first
select the UML Package to be exported, then click on "Publish As..." as shown
in <<fig-ea-publish-as>>.

[[fig-ea-publish-as]]
.Location of the "Publish As..." button
image::ea-publish-as.png[]

Clicking on the "Publish As..." button opens a dialog box with the options
shown in <<fig-ea-export-options>>.

[[fig-ea-export-options]]
.Generation options for an XMI that works with Metanorma
image::ea-generate-model.png[]

The user will need to export the file with the following configuration set:

* Filename change the file extension to use `.xmi` in the "..." dialog box
* XML Type set to "UML 2.4.1 (XMI 2.4.2)"
* Check the following boxes in "General Options":
** Export Diagrams
** Format XML Output
** Generate Diagram Images, set Format to "Metafile"
* Click on "Export"

When these steps are followed the exported XMI will be at the path specified,
ready to serve as input for the MDS process.


== Basics of Metanorma

=== General

Metanorma uses a syntax called Metanorma AsciiDoc, which is based on the
AsciiDoc format with a number of extensions.

=== Document structure and encoding

==== General

An OGC Metanorma document is composed of two parts:

* Metadata
* Content body

==== Metadata

The metadata portion is composed of the document header and attributes.
An example of the metadata portion is shown below.

=== Linking the XMI file to Metanorma

The automatic inclusion behavior is implemented by the
`lutaml_uml_datamodel_description` command with a YAML
configuration file using the following steps:

. In every UML package of the model file, investigate every UML class

. If the UML package contains diagrams (in the `xmi-19170-only/Images` folder),
  include them all before content generation.

. If there is a requirements Metanorma AsciiDoc file that uses the current UML
  package's name, include the file as content before content generation.

. Render the UML class into the default UML representation template
  (embedded in LutaML).

==== Relationships

A class can be set with multiple relationships.

These relationships are described in the MDS process.

Generalization:: the target class will be described as a "superclass", and the
source class will be listed as a "subclass" of the target class.

Dependency:: the source class will be listed as a "dependency" of the target.

Realization:: EA creates Realization relationships from every UML class to the
class itself, and these are not rendered in the MDA process.


=== Property

==== Name

The property should have a unique name within the class it belongs to.

==== Description

The property description is entered in the Notes pane.

==== Unspecified value type

If there is no value type specified for an property, create an
"AbstractValueType" data type and assign it to the property
(see <<fig-abstract-value-type>>).

=== Enumeration

==== Name

The enumeration should have a unique name within the package it belongs to.

==== Description

The enumeration description is entered in the Notes pane.

=== Enumeration values

==== Name

The enumeration value should have a unique name within the enumeration it belongs to.

==== Description

The enumeration value description is entered in the Notes pane.


=== Figure

Figures are automatically included in the package description.
